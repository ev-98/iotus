          <p>A New Life Line is a web development project taken on as a part of a group during a software engineering course at the University of Florida.
            In terms of practical experience, this development process was the most insightful on understanding the lifespan of shipping products in modern 
            software engineering teams. Broken down in Agile development formatting with a Scrum Master and Development Leader per team, each group of students
            met with real life clients in the area to turn their ideas into visible software. Our client wished for a site that would allow as a meeting place for ex-felons 
            looking for tips and advice on how to turn their lives around, and A New Life Line was created as a prototype model in response.
          </p>

          <p>Using React as our primary front-end library and MongoDB as our user storage database, the site was deployed with various features including register/login functionality, a Google calendar API
            for events, Zoom integration for meetups, a resume builder that a PDF from user inputs, and an announcements tab with messages stored in Firebase to display in realtime. In terms of programming,
            my primary task was the announcement integration as well as organizing server routes. To me personally, this project serves as a learning experience for
            team programming, communicating with clients, completing projects on unexpected deadline cuts, dividing up work -- essentially, things that often go undiscussed when working on a large codebase in a real-world scenario.
