          <p>Teklog is a full-stack "open"-style blog site created for my friends and I to jot down the data that we pick up playing Bandai-Namco's fighting game TEKKEN 7.
            Since improving at TEKKEN requires knowledge of small, often times overlooked scenarios and no way to properly remember them in-game, this was created as an open 
            "notebook" to jot down things to work on in the middle of sets before forgetting them afterwards. This site was the first full stack Node.js app I worked on personally
            and being able to redefine post functions to manipulate data made it easy to understand back-end development as well as the deployment process to Heroku. 
          </p>

          <p>At the time of typing this, one obvious issue this site has is the fact that anybody can completely edit or delete data at will.
          During this project's development, I became more invested in attempting to get message post and delete functionality working and neglected this issue. Now that
          the site is live, however, if was to continue moving forward with this site I would most likely create a universal password so as not not stray too far from the idea
          of this being easily accessible and editable.
