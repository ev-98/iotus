          <p>This bot was created with the purpose of compiling and organizing data from Capcom's 1999 fighting game Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.
            Street Fighter III, along with other fighting games, can be broken down by the number of key frames that make up every animation of every move
            by every character. By knowing how long a move takes to come out or lasts after being block/hit, you can make deductions on whether or not your opponent's attack is "safe"
            and if the attack you wish to respond with will be "safe" on retaliation.
          </p>

          <p>This bot contains the data for every attacking move in the game, as well as matchup information that displays the odds of winning between two characters based on strengths/
            weaknesses. This data is then passed into a bot instance that runs on servers hosted by Discord, a voice chat client popular among the gaming community, so as long as the bot is 
            invited and active in a server, users may use one of the defined commands to look up data quickly and easily.
